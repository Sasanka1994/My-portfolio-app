    <h3 style="color:#E6E6E1;">Welcome to Revin's portfolio </h3>
    <p>This is the home page of Revin's, a software developer based in Canberra. Hello!!!</p>
    <h4 style="color:#E6E6E1;">I like...</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Angular</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>PHP</li>
      <li>MySQL</li>
      <li>IONIC</li>
      <li>Next.js</li>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
      <li>AWS</li>
      <li>Linux</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="color:#E6E6E1;">I don't like...</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure's UI. I prefer AWS. (But I can deal with it ðŸ˜‰)</li>
      <li>Internet Explorer</li>
      <li>Non-fan-forced ovens</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="color:#E6E6E1;">This looks like an "app"!!!</h4>
    <p>What do you mean by "app" exactly? Regardless, this website looks the way it does because it's using 
      Ionic Framework. It's probably overkill for this use case, and I may change it later, but I'm enjoying 
      Ionic+angular recently.
    </p>
    <p>Also, this is running on NGINX in a Docker container, in AWS' Elastic Container Service!. Why Docker and AWS ECS? Docker is a
      tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. Thus containers allow to package up
      an application with all of the part it needs and deploy it as one package. Furthermore AWS' ECS is a fully managed container 
      orchestration service. From this I can make a module to learn CI/CD pipelines in hands on experience.
    </p>
    <p>I am planning to deploy my own automated Jenkins-based build porcess, too; Jenkins will be scanning my remote git repository
      for changes,then if it finds any, builds and deploys the containerised application automatically, versioning it 
      using per-environment logic and a date-time string. The current version is (need to setup/ still on under construction).
